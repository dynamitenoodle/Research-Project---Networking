# Research-Project---Networking
We'll be creating a generic UDP Server to Client connection that will be able to interface with a DLL that can then be added to any project and allow use of the networking structure we create.

Step 1: Setup Server to Client Connection
Step 2: Create a framework in which generic packets can be saved and stored in select memory allocations
Step 3: Ensure that multiple client connections work with framework
Step 4: Create a DLL that is able to use client's commands to interface with the server instance
Step 5: Create a project that can utilize the DLL
